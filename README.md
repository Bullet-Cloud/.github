# Welcome to Bullet Infotech

Here you find our library of open-source SDKs and libraries developed over years and used in production for many sites.

Open-source is close to our hearts. We love creating reusable software and sharing these with the community. We believe that having a large open-source footprint, allows us to build higher quality solutions, faster and with more consistency.

Our open-source projects focus mainly on the following:

- SAAS Softwares
- Platform SDKs and libraries
- Cloudnative tools and libraries for Python / Java / PHP
- ➡️ [For our MACH composer related open source projects, please view its separate Github organisation](https://github.com/mach-composer)
